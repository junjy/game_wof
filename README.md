## GA SEIF3 - Project #1: WHEEL OF FORTUNE ##


## someDescription ##
This basic 'Hangman' word puzzle game is based on the popular Wheel of Fortune gameshow with some minor variations. 

## howToPlay ##
1. **This is a single-player game.** 
- There is still a total of 24 values on the wheel (between $300 to $3000 or 'BANKRUPT') but no 'LOSE A TURN' option.

2. **You can play up to 3 rounds per game.** Each round features 1 word puzzle (phrase or sentence). 
- Your goal is to solve all puzzles at the end of 3 rounds without spinning 'BANKRUPT' or making a wrong guess.
- You may exit the game at any time.

3. **At the start of each round**, you can only Spin the Wheel.
- Thereafter, you can choose any of the following 3 options:-
(1) Spin the Wheel
(2) Buy a Vowel
(3) Solve the Puzzle

## upTheStakes! ##
Challenge yourself by turning on the countdown timer! You will be subject to the following time limits:- 
- Guess a Consonant: 5 sec
- Buy a Vowel: 5 sec
- Solve the Puzzle: 15 sec

After guessing each correct letter, you need to decide on your next step (Spin Wheel/Buy a Vowel/Solve the Puzzle) **within 10 sec too!**

Definitely not for the faint of heart! ;)
